I am a computational microbiologist and university lecturer in microbial bioinformatics at the University of Helsinki. I'm also one of the founders of [Aluke](https://www.aluke.fi).  

My research focuses on the environemntal dimension of antimicrobial resistance. I am especially interested in studying the genes behind the resistance and how they emerge and move between bacteria, using computational tools to better understand these processes. You can find more information about my projects under [Projects]({% link _pages/projects.md %}) and some example of the workflows under [Repositories]({% link _pages/repositories.md %}).  

In addition to research, I enjoy teaching and creating educational materials that help others learn bioinformatics and microbiology in a clear and practical way. I aim to make complex scientific ideas easier to understand and to support students and colleagues in their learning journeys. Learn more about my teaching under [Teaching]({% link _pages/teaching.md %}).
